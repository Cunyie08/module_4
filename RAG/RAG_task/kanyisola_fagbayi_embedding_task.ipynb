    "## Exercise 1: Understanding Embedding Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Explore how embeddings capture semantic similarity between different texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the sample sentences below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sentences = [\n",
    "    \"The dog is playing in the park\",\n",
    "    \"A puppy is running outside\",\n",
    "    \"The cat is sleeping on the couch\",\n",
    "    \"Python is a programming language\",\n",
    "    \"Machine learning models need data\",\n",
    "    \"I love coding in Python\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate embeddings for all sentences using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate similarity scores between:\n",
    "   - Sentence 1 and all others\n",
    "   - Sentence 4 and all others\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Answer these questions:\n",
    "   - Which sentences are most similar to \"The dog is playing in the park\"?\n",
    "   - Which sentences are most similar to \"Python is a programming language\"?\n",
    "   - What similarity threshold would you use to filter unrelated content?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Query: \"The dog is playing in the park\"\n",
    "Most similar: ?\n",
    "Least similar: ?\n",
    "Observations: ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Query: \"Python is a programming language\"\n",
    "Most similar: ?\n",
    "Least similar: ?\n",
    "Observations: ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended similarity threshold: ?\n",

    "## Exercise 2: Chunk Size Impact on Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Understand how chunk size affects retrieval quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use this long document:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "document = \"\"\"\n",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to\n",
    "the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define\n",
    "the field as the study of intelligent agents: any device that perceives its environment\n",
    "and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the use of data\n",
    "and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.\n",
    "Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial\n",
    "neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised\n",
    "or unsupervised. Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief\n",
    "networks, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied\n",
    "to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing,\n",
    "machine translation, and bioinformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial\n",
    "intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in\n",
    "particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural\n",
    "language data. Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech\n",
    "recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Chunk this document using 3 different sizes:\n",
    "   - Small: 100 characters\n",
    "   - Medium: 200 characters\n",
    "   - Large: 400 characters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each chunk size:\n",
    "   - Create embeddings\n",
    "   - Test with query: \"What is machine learning?\"\n",
    "   - Retrieve top 3 chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare results:\n",
    "   - Which chunk size gave the most focused answer?\n",
    "   - Which gave the most complete answer?\n",
    "   - Which had the best balance?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Chunk Size Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "Small Chunks (100 chars):\n",
    "- Number of chunks: ?\n",
    "- Top result: \"?\"\n",
    "- Score: ?\n",
